His major fault was not believing that hydrolox was a suitable propellant for a space engine.

When looking into high-altitude flight, he calculated that the speed required to produce enough lift for a airplane to stay aloft would be the same as orbital speed at 82 kilometers altitude. This was then rounded to 100 kilometers and is why the Karman line is considered the boundary of space.
